Most of the files in this repository are from an algorithms class I took a year ago. I also started a hashing program, which I am putting into the Hashing folder and an experimental Dice game, which is in Dice. Of particular interest is Lab 3, where I implemented a Red Black tree from scratch. I intend this repository to be used as a reference for those who would like to see examples of different algorithms and data structures. I hope to continue updating this repository when I get the time. If something doesn't work or you have any questions, you can message me on my GitHub account: mlinsenbardt.
